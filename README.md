# Chinese Car Price Prediction
An Automobile consulting company wants to understand the factors
on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors 
affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be
very different from the Chinese market. So we use a Multiple Linear Regression Model for 
the prediction of car prices. It is been built by using a **Stats Model**.

So that they can accordingly manipulate the design of
the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model
will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new
market.
